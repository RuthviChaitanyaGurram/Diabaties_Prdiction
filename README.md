Introduction
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in its management and prevention of complications. This project aims to develop machine learning models that can predict diabetes based on various patient attributes such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, and medical history.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized patient information, including demographic details, medical history, and clinical measurements. It includes features such as:

Gender
Age
Hypertension
Heart disease
Smoking history
BMI (Body Mass Index)
HbA1c level
Blood glucose level
Diabetes status (target variable)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset, understand feature distributions, identify correlations, and detect any patterns or anomalies. Key visualizations include histograms, box plots, correlation matrices, and feature distributions by diabetes status.

Machine Learning Models
Three different machine learning models are implemented and evaluated for diabetes prediction:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The models are trained on the dataset and evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The performance of each model is assessed based on evaluation metrics and visualizations. Additionally, actual vs. predicted plots are generated to visualize model predictions.

Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
